# Description
The Eqivalent Carbon Number (ECN) tool was developed to process large-scale lipid data obtained from Astral-MS. This tool integrate the advantages of MS-DIAL (providing precise lipid retention behavior) and LipidSearch (offering accurate MS/MS spectral information). The ECN tool consists of two modules designed to integrate and optimize the functions of the two software platforms. The first module was designed to establish the ECN model based on lipid information processed by MS-DIAL including the lipid information extraction and ECN model construction. The second module removes spurious lipid data from LipidSearch using the ECN model. The additional module 3 is provided herein to be used to compare the results of the two after they have been processed by the ECN model, respectively.
# Before You Start: Important Notes
1. The preprocess result from MS-DIAL and LipidSearch was imported into the corresponding input folder. Running the _Module1-1-data preprocess.py_ and _Module1-2-construction of ECN model.py_ first.
2. In _Module2-1-Lipid class match.py_, a step to filter unreasonable adducts from LipidSearch results has been added to meet the needs of our work. The program removes the [M+H] adducts of TGs and DGs, as well as all [M+COOH] adducts (since ammonium acetate was used in our work). Users can modify the unresonable adduction types to suit different needs.
For users who can't modify the code, we suggest that you can directly delete the code in lines 18-25 of _Module2-1-Lipid class match.py_. And achieve the same result by manually deleting unreasonable adduct forms before running the script.
3. Before running the _Module2-2-analysis of lipidsearch data.py_, you need to change the index file name into the corresponding ECN model file name from the Module1-output-2 folder.
4. You also need to change the index file name into the ECN model file name in the _Module3-analysis of MS-DIAL data.py_ file before running it.
